# Investigating-Determinants-of-Plasma-Beta-Carotene-and-Retinol-Levels
 This study examined the associations of plasma beta-carotene and retinol levels  with personal and dietary characteristics in 315 patients.  Plasma beta-carotene
 levels were positively associated with fiber intake, age, and vitamin use, and nega
tively associated with the Quetelet index and cholesterol intake. Nonsmokers and
 former smokers had higher beta-carotene levels than current smokers, with vita
min use amplifying the effect of dietary beta-carotene intake. Plasma retinol levels
 showed positive associations with age and dietary beta-carotene, and heavy alcohol
 intake was associated with higher retinol levels. Despite significant associations, the
 moderate-to-low adjusted R-squared highlights the need for further investigation of
 influential factors.
